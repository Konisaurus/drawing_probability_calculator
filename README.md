A python algorithm for calculating the chances of drawing a sample of cards from a deck.

Includes a GUI for setting up a desired sample hand. The deck selection has not implemented yet.

Inculdes two models for calculating the probability of a sample hand:
- model_hypgeo.py calculates the probability of a certain sample with the hypergeometric probability/cumulative 
  distribution function.
- model_simulation.py (NOT FULLY IMPLEMENTED YET) draws a random sample hand multiple times and counts if the sample a
  success or not.
